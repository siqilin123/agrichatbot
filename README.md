## Project Setup

To open the project, you will need Unity 2022.2 and add the OpenAI API Key to the System Environment Variables on Windows/Mac.

### Windows:

1. Use the search bar in the Start menu to find "Edit the system environment variables".
2. Click on "Environment variables".
3. Use the upper "New..." button to add a User variable.
4. Create a new variable called OPENAI_API_KEY and set the value to the secret key you obtained from your account settings on openai.com.

### Mac:

1. Find the .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc file in your home directory.
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Add a new line to the file, as follows:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_secret_key_here>
Please note that for Mac, you need to determine which file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, or .zshrc) to modify based on your specific shell configuration.
